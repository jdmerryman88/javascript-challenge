# javascript-challenge

In this javascript project two different projects were completed.

UFO-Level-1

In the first project javascript is used to create a table on an html page (ufo-level-1/index.html). This is done using the data array in ufo-level-1/static/js/data.js file and using the function in ufo-level-1/static/js/app.js file. After the table is initially populated on the index.html page a search box is also available to filter the data by date. Entering no date in the search will return the entire dataset because no filtering was requested. This will also log to the console a statement that no date was entered. However, when a date is entered and the fitler table button is clicked or enter key pressed the data will be filtered by the date requested. At this point only the date requested data will populate the table. 

UFO-Level-2

In the second project more fields for fitlering were added to the html file (ufo-level-2/index.html). The added filter options are now by date, city, state, country and shape. The filtering and table population is completed using the ufo-level-2/static/js/app.js file and pulling data from ufo-level-2/static/js/data.js file. This function now allows the user to filter the data using one of the other search fields.
